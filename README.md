The `dune-mmesh` module
=======================

The `dune-mmesh` module is an implementation of the `dune-grid` interface that wraps CGAL triangulations in 2D and 3D.
It is also capable to export a prescribed set of cell facets as a dim-1 interface grid and remesh the grid when moving this interface.

Installation
------------

`dune-mmesh` requires the DUNE core modules, version 2.7 or later.

Additionally, you'll need a current version of `CGAL` installed on your system.

Examples
--------

See the `examples` folder for some grid creations.
You can either use a `.msh` file, a `.dgf` file or the `CGAL` triangulation interface directly.

Short example using the GmshReader:
````
    #include <dune/mmesh/mmesh.hh>

    using Grid = Dune::MovingMesh< dim >;

    using GridFactory = Dune::GmshGridFactory< Grid >;
    GridFactory gridFactory( "grid.msh" );

    Grid& grid = *gridFactory.grid();

    using InterfaceGrid = typename Grid::InterfaceGrid;
    const InterfaceGrid& igrid = grid.interfaceGrid();
````

Remark that the .msh files must be built using ``gmsh -<dim> -format msh2 grid.geo``.
