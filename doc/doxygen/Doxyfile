# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should
# set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string) v.s.
# func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
