Moving Mesh
***********

Most interface driven-problems have time-dependent interfaces :math:`\Gamma = \Gamma(t)`.
Therefore, Dune-MMesh features capabilities of moving and remeshing in spatial dimension two.

Moving Vertices
***************

Dune-MMesh allows the movement of the interface and even all grid vertices by a predescribed movement.
We assume that movement is given by the shift of vertices.
This movement can be performed by changing the coordinates of vertices.
For this purpose, Dune-MMesh provides the method

.. code-block:: cpp

  moveInterface(shifts)

that takes a vector of shift coordinates indexed by interface vertex indices.

.. tikz:: Moving the interface.

  \draw (D) -- (E) -- (B2);

  \draw (C2) -- (J) -- (K);
  \draw (C2) -- (G) -- (B2);
  \draw[very thick] (A2) -- (B2) -- (C2);


A second method :code:`moveVertices` is available for moving all vertices of the triangulation that is indexed by bulk vertex indices.


Remark that moving might lead to degeneration of the triangulation, i.e. cells can have non-positive volume.
To prevent that, Dune-MMesh is equipped with remeshing routines.


Adaptation
**********

Adaption in DUNE is hierarchical by definition. Whenever a grid element is supposed to be refined,
it is split into smaller cells belonging to a higher level of the grid hierarchy.
If all children in the highest refinement level of a grid element are supposed to be coarsenend,
the children cells are put together again to form a single father cell one level lower.

Hereby, the adaptation procedure is performed in two stages:
  1. Mark: Grid elements are marked for coarsening or refinement.
  2. Adapt: The elements are adapted due to their markers and discrete functions are restricted or prolongated.

In Dune-MMesh, due to the moving mesh, non-hierarchic adaptation is inavoidable.
However, we will try to follow th general DUNE approach of adaptation as good as possible.
For this reason, we similarily separate the adaptation into the following two stages.

Mark
----

In advance of moving, the method

.. code-block:: cpp

  ensureInterfaceMovement(shifts)

(respectively :code:`ensureVertexMovement`) can be called to prepare Dune-MMesh for moving the vertices.
The routine checks for presumbly degenerate cells and marks them for coarsening. Hence, they will be removed during adaptation.

The second method available for marking elements is

.. code-block:: cpp

  markElements()

which uses a default indicator that marks elements
for coarsening or refinement depending on their current geometrical properties.

.. tikz:: Marking elements. Here, green for refinement, red for coarsening.
  :xscale: 25

  \coordinate (A) at (-0.7,-0.5);
  \coordinate (B) at (1,1);
  \coordinate (C) at (1.5,1.5);
  \coordinate (D) at (0.2,1.2);
  \coordinate (E) at (0.1,3);
  \coordinate (F) at (1.1,-0.6);
  \coordinate (G) at (1.8,0.4);
  \coordinate (H) at (0.5,0.1);
  \draw[fill=black!40!green] (A) -- (D) -- (B);
  \draw (D) -- (E) -- (B);
  \draw[fill=black!40!green] (B) -- (E) -- (C);
  \draw[fill=black!10!red] (A) -- (H) -- (B);
  \draw (A) -- (F) -- (B);
  \draw (H) -- (F) -- (G);
  \draw (C) -- (G) -- (B);
  \draw[very thick] (A) -- (B) -- (C);

  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (A) -- +(0.1,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (B) -- +(0.2,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (C) -- +(0.5,-0.3);



This indicator considers primarily maximal and minimal edge length.
The objective edge length range between :math:`h_{max}` and :math:`h_{min}` is determined automatically at grid initialization.
If an edge is longer than the maximum edge length :math:`h_{max}`, the cell will be marked for refine.
If an edge is shorter than the minimum edge length :math:`h_{min}`, the cell will be marked for coarsening.

Additionally, if the ratio of longest to shortest edge is larger than 4, the cell is marked for coarsening.
The number 4 occurs from the fact that we we will use bisection and a triangle where two edges are longer then :math:`h_{max}`
should not be splitted into smaller triangles where an edge is shorter than :math:`h_{min}`.

Finally, a maximal radius ratio is taken into account to remove very ugly cells.
Always coarsening has priority before refinement.

The minimal and maximal edge lengths :math:`h_{max}` and :math:`h_{min}` are
initialized automatically when constructing a mesh by determining the range of edge lengths occuring the grid.

The `markElements()` routine also checks all elements of the interface grid.
Therefore, the interface will be refined and coarsened as well if edges of the interface get too long or too short.

.. note:: The method `markElements()` is just a convenience method iterating over the grid and setting the element markers
  due to the default indicator value. It is also possible to use a proprietary procedure marking the elements manually
  using `removeVertex(vertex)` and `refineEdge(element, edgeIndex)`.


Adapt
-----

After marking elements the

.. code-block:: cpp

 adapt()

routine performs the actual adaptation process.

.. tikz:: Inserting and removing points.
  :xscale: 25

  \coordinate (A) at (-0.7,-0.5);
  \coordinate (B) at (1,1);
  \coordinate (C) at (1.5,1.5);
  \coordinate (D) at (0.2,1.2);
  \coordinate (E) at (0.1,3);
  \coordinate (F) at (1.1,-0.6);
  \coordinate (G) at (1.8,0.4);
  \coordinate (H) at (0.5,0.1);
  \coordinate (I) at ($(A)!0.5!(B)$);
  \coordinate (J) at ($(B)!0.5!(E)$);
  \coordinate (K) at ($(C)!0.5!(E)$);

  \draw (A) -- (D) -- (B);
  \draw (D) -- (E) -- (B);
  \draw (B) -- (E) -- (C);
  \draw (A) -- (F) -- (B);
  \draw (I) -- (F) -- (G);
  \draw (I) -- (D);
  \draw (J) -- (D);
  \draw (C) -- (J) -- (K);
  \draw (C) -- (G) -- (B);
  \draw[very thick] (A) -- (B) -- (C);

  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (A) -- +(0.1,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (B) -- +(0.2,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (C) -- +(0.5,-0.3);

  \draw[fill, black!40!green] (I) circle (2pt);
  \draw[fill, black!40!green] (J) circle (2pt);
  \draw[fill, black!40!green] (K) circle (2pt);
  \draw[fill, black!10!red] (H) circle (2pt);


The adaptation is performed by insertion and removal of points.
In each element that is marked for refinement the center of the longest edge is interserted,
i.e. refinement is done via bisection.
In all elements marked for coarsening, one vertex is removed. Here, the vertex incident to the
shortest edges of the cell is chosen, but we give priority on non-interface and non-boundary vertices.
When a vertex is removed, the resulting whole is retriangulated with respect to the interface.

For the purpose of projection we introduce *connected components*.
These are defined as sets of cells from the triangulation before adaptation that
cover the same area as a set of cells in the triangulation afterwards.
The easiest representatives of these connected components are the incident cells when bisecting an edge and
the incident cells to a vertex that is to be removed.
Though, we have to combine overlapping sets of these representatives.

.. tikz:: Connected components.

  \coordinate (B) at (1,1);
  \coordinate (C) at (1.5,1.5);
  \coordinate (D) at (0.2,1.2);
  \coordinate (E) at (0.1,3);
  \coordinate (F) at (1.1,-0.6);
  \coordinate (G) at (1.8,0.4);
  \coordinate (H) at (0.5,0.1);
  \draw[fill=yellow] (D) -- (E) -- (B);
  \draw[fill=yellow] (B) -- (E) -- (C);
  \draw[fill=white!70!blue] (A) -- (D) -- (B);
  \draw[fill=white!70!blue] (A) -- (F) -- (B);
  \draw (A) -- (H) -- (B);
  \draw (G) -- (F) -- (H);
  \draw (A) -- (F) -- (B);
  \draw (C) -- (G) -- (B);
  \draw[very thick] (A) -- (B) -- (C);

  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (A) -- +(0.1,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (B) -- +(0.2,-0.4);
  \draw[->, black!20!blue, thick] (C) -- +(0.5,-0.3);


For a conservative projection of discrete functions we compute a cut-set triangulation
which enables evalutation with agglomerated quadrature rules on triangles.
Here, we prolong from an old cell onto such a cut triangle and prolong onto the new cell.
This whole projection is performed under the hood and just assumes that you use the callback adaptation in dune-fem.
We use a similar concept on the interface grid that enables projection of discrete functions on the interface.

.. note::
  The remeshing feature is not (yet) supported in spatial dimension three because the removal of a vertex is not
  offered by the underlying CGAL Triangulation_3 class. In fact, it could appear that the region formed by its
  adjacent tetrahedrons is an instance of the untetrahedralizable Sch√∂nhardt's polyhedron. In this case, the
  removal of the vertex might be impossible without rebuilding the whole triangulation.
