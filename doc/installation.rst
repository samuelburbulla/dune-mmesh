Installation
************


Using Docker
------------

The easiest starting point is to use Docker with a preconfigured setup.
Build the corresponding Docker container as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build -t mmesh \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelburbulla/dune-mmesh/master/scripts/Dockerfile
  docker run -it mmesh

This will open an interactive shell in the Dune-MMesh's examples directory.


On your system
--------------

In order to install and use Dune-MMesh you need:

C++ compiler (at least C++17 compatible, e.g. clang >= 5 or g++ >= 7),
CMake (3.13 or later),
Python3 (3.7 or later) + pip (+ venv),
pkg-config,
Boost (1.66 or later),
OpenMPI (this will become optional),
SuiteSparse (we use UMFPack) and
Gmsh.


On Linux the requirements could be installed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt install g++ cmake python3 python3-pip python3-venv pkg-config libboost-dev libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin libsuitesparse-dev gmsh git git-lfs


On MacOS, you can install the required dependencies by installing the Xcode Command Line Tools and using Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

  xcode-select --install
  brew install pkg-config boost openmpi suite-sparse gmsh git-lfs


There are two ways to install Dune-MMesh, either from PyPI or from source.

Using Pip
---------

The easiest way to install Dune-MMesh is using pip and the package uploaded to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/dune-mmesh/>`_.

1. Activate a virtual environment (strongly recommended).

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 -m venv dune-env
  source dune-env/bin/activate

This requires that you have `venv` available (`apt install python3-venv`).

2. Download and build Dune-MMesh and its dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install dune-mmesh

Note that this takes some time in order to compile all dependent Dune modules.

Now, you should be able to execute Dune-MMesh's python code. For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/samuelburbulla/dune-mmesh.git
  cd dune-mmesh/doc/examples
  python coupling.py

Remark that a `dune-py` module will be generated automatically that is necessary to perform the just-in-time compilation of DUNE python modules.


If you encounter problems with, e.g., Boost headers missing on an M1 Mac,
make sure that the include paths can be found. For instance, use the export

.. code-block:: bash

  export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/boost/1.66.0/include/"

before installing Dune-MMesh.

Please be aware that we use `git-lfs` for uploading the `.msh` files.
In order to pull them, please activate large file storage.


From Source
-----------

You can install Dune-MMesh from source to get full access to the source code.
It also enables git support if you want to contribute.

1. Clone the Dune modules `dune-common <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-common.git>`_,
`dune-geometry <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-geometry.git>`_,
`dune-grid <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-grid.git>`_,
`dune-istl <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-istl.git>`_,
`dune-localfunctions <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-localfunctions.git>`_,
`dune-alugrid <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/extensions/dune-alugrid.git>`_
`dune-fem <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/dune-fem/dune-fem.git>`_
and `dune-mmesh <https://gitlab.dune-project.org/samuel.burbulla/dune-mmesh.git>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-common.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-geometry.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-grid.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-istl.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-localfunctions.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/extensions/dune-alugrid.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/dune-fem/dune-fem.git
  git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/samuel.burbulla/dune-mmesh.git

2. Build the modules. This will create an internal virtual environment and install the python bindings.

.. code-block:: bash

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dune-mmesh/cmake/config.opts all

3. Activate the DUNE internal virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash

  source ./dune-common/build-cmake/dune-env/bin/activate
