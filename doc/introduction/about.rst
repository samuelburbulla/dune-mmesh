What is dune-mmesh?
*******************

The dune-mmesh module is an implementation of the `DUNE <https://www.dune-project.org>`_
grid interface that wraps `CGAL <https://www.cgal.org>`_ triangulations in 2D and 3D.
It is capable to export a prescribed set of cell facets as a dim-1 interface grid.
It implements a non-hierarchical remeshing for arbitrary movement of vertices of the triangulation.
