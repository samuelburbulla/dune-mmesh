******************************************
The DUNE grid module for moving interfaces
******************************************

Dune-MMesh is an implementation of the `DUNE <https://www.dune-project.org>`_ grid interface that
is tailored for numerical applications with moving physical interfaces.
The implementation based on `CGAL <https://www.cgal.org>`_ triangulations supports two and three dimensional meshes
and can export a predefined set of facets as a separate interface grid.
In spatial dimension two, arbitrary movement of vertices is enhanced with a remeshing algorithm
that implements non-hierarchical adaptation procedures.
